\section{Presentation}
Use this checklist to make sure you're prepared!
\begin{description}
\item {\bf [  ] Running} Project is in a runnable state.
\item {\bf [  ] General Grading} You have met (or will have met) the custom grading criteria.
\item {\bf [  ] Specific Grading} You have met (or will have met) the custom grading criteria.
\item {\bf [  ] Presentation} You've prepared a 10-15 minute presentation and demo of your system, delivered by your captain. This should be {\bf prepared and professional}. Slides are optional, though a visual aid other than your application is highly recommended.
\item {\bf [  ] Equipment} Test connecting your machine(s) to the projector system. Both VGA and DVI projector connections will be provided.
\item {\bf [  ] Submission} {\it All} of your project materials must be submitted via the appropriate Dropbox folder. (See Blackboard for instructions.) I will pull your materials for final grading no later than Friday.
\item {\bf [  ] Practice} While your captain will be leading your presentation, I {\it may} ask questions to other members. Practice the fluidity and timing of your presentation and make sure {\it everyone} is prepared.
